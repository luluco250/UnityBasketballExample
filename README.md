# Basketball Example

This is a small project of a FPS-like basktball game, meant for use in teaching Unity.


The controls are simple, use WASD to move and to pick-up an object simply right-click it.
You can then throw it by holding the left mouse button, the longer you hold the more force is applied.
You can also drop it using the right mouse button.
